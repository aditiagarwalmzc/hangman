# hangman

Users have to guess the word by guessing each each letter of the word. There are four categories: TV Shows, Movies, Taylor Swift and Programming. The user gets 10 lives and they lose each life with each incorrect guess. A part of the hangman is drawn as the users guesses incorrectly. When the user uses all of their lives, i.e. when the hangman is complete, the user loses the game. If they guess the word correctly before running out of lives, they win the game.
